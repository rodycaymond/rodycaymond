My name is Cody Raymond and I'm a fullstack web developer. I started learning HTML/CSS (like most everyone else), followed by some javascript. But I never could have imagined it would lead to where I am today as a developer.  The unknowns of software development as a new developer are quite daunting; there's literally so much out there to learn. But if you take it one step at a time, and try not to rush it, it all comes together in the end. Learning code should always be fun, but that's on you to make it fun. Difficult concepts can be always be made into games or fun little exercises which help to reduce the strain of learning those new concepts. Thinking back to when I started, I would have never thought I'd know all the different languages and methodologies I know now. It most certainly didn't happen over night, but I'm grateful for sticking it through and opening myself up to the amazing opportunities I've had so far. Feel free to reach out to me and ask anything you'd like! If you want some help or possibly want to collaborate on a project, let me know!
