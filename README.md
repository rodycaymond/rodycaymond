Hey all, my name is Cody and I'm a junior fullstack web developer. I love coding because its quite literally never disappoints to serve up a brand new problem which requires all of the same critical thinking skills as every other problem before. And the feeling of satisfaction when you make something work? Man......anyways, my current Techstack is React, Material-UI, Express, Knex, and PSQL. I thoroughly enjoy the fullstack approach, but admittedly find myself drawn to more of the front end stuff. Nevertheless, theres something magical about working with server requests, too. Feel free to comb through any of my repos and fork/clone as you wish. If you ever want to collaborate or learn some new concepts together, I'd be more than happy to oblige!
