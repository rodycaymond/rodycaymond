Hey everyone! My name is Cody and I'm an aspiring software developer!
I'm currently savvy on Javascript, HTML/CSS, and some python!
Learning more everyday, specifically some ReactJS and NodeJS at the moment.
Please feel free to check out some of the projects and code snippets I've been working on in my various repositories.
Though a little sparse, there is definitely more projects to come in the near future as I dive deeper in to ReactJS!
I'd love to collaborate if you are wanting to simply have some fun or learn together.
